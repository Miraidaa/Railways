          <h2>Game Rules</h2>
          <p>Welcome to *The Kingdom's Railway Network*! Your objective is to connect the towns of Seeknotland by building a complete railway network across a grid. Plan your routes carefully and compete against the clock to finish the network as fast as possible!</p>
          
          <h3>How to Play</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>Choose a difficulty level to set the size of the map:
                  <ul>
                      <li><strong>Easy</strong> – A 5x5 grid</li>
                      <li><strong>Hard</strong> – A 7x7 grid</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Once the game begins, you’ll see a grid representing different terrain tiles in Seeknotland.</li>
              <li>Your goal is to place railway tracks to connect all towns within the grid.</li>
              <li>Each tile can be connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally based on valid railway placement rules.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3>Rules for Railway Placement</h3>
          <ul>
              <li>Railways can only be placed on designated tiles. Watch out for blocked or restricted areas!</li>
              <li>Make sure that your railway connections form a complete path without gaps or dead-ends.</li>
              <li>The railway network must form a closed loop that connects back to its starting point.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Good luck, and may your trains run smoothly!</p>
